# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We support the latest released version of `thunderbird-mcp`. Older
versions receive no fixes; the recommended path for any security
finding is to upgrade to the current release.

| Version  | Supported          |
| -------- | ------------------ |
| latest   | ✅                 |
| < latest | ❌                 |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not file a public GitHub issue for security findings.**

Use GitHub's [private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/TKasperczyk/thunderbird-mcp/security/advisories/new)
on this repository. That route:

- keeps the report private until a fix is available,
- generates a CVE if appropriate,
- coordinates disclosure with downstream Thunderbird users.

Acknowledgement target: 72 hours. Triage and a first response on
severity + likely fix path: 7 days. Substantive fixes for confirmed
vulnerabilities ship as a patch release.

## What's in scope

This project bridges three trust boundaries; any of them is in scope:

1. **JSON-RPC over stdin** to `mcp-bridge.cjs`. Adversarial input
   includes malformed JSON, oversized payloads, control characters,
   prototype pollution attempts.
2. **HTTP transport** between the bridge and the Thunderbird
   extension (`http://localhost:<port>` with token auth). Token
   handling, timing-safe comparison, port-binding hygiene.
3. **Tool dispatch inside the extension** (`extension/mcp_server/api.js`).
   The permission engine + per-tool argument validation are the
   primary boundary. Any path that lets a caller exceed their
   declared permission scope, or that accesses Thunderbird state
   outside the permission's intent (e.g. reading another account's
   mailbox via a tool that should only see Inbox), is in scope.
4. **Native messaging / WebExtension experiment surface**. The
   extension runs in Thunderbird's chrome context with XPCOM
   privileges -- any path that leaks XPCOM capabilities to an
   unauthenticated caller is in scope.

## What's out of scope

- DoS against `mcp-bridge.cjs` from a process that already has
  local-user trust (the bridge runs in the user's session; that's
  the threat model's TCB by design).
- Behaviour of `npm audit` / `dependabot` flagged transitive deps
  unless there is a confirmed runtime-exploitable path. We ship
  no production npm `dependencies`; only devDeps are exposed.
- Pre-release / unmerged feature branches. Report against `main`
  or the latest release.

## Update channel

Installed copies update themselves from
`https://updates.tomaszkasperczyk.name/thunderbird-mcp/updates.json`,
which the release workflow publishes to the `gh-pages` branch when a
`v*` tag is pushed. Only the maintainer can push tags or change
`gh-pages`; both are protected by repository rulesets, and releases are
immutable. The domain is the maintainer's personal domain and will stay
registered. If the project is ever handed over, the maintainer will ship
a final release that moves `update_url` to the new maintainer's channel,
and keep the domain serving the last manifest until installs have moved.

## Coordinated disclosure

We follow the Mozilla / Thunderbird coordinated-disclosure cadence
where the issue intersects upstream Thunderbird internals. If your
finding touches `nsIMsgSend`, `nsIMsgCompose`, or other XPCOM
interfaces, we may forward (with credit) to
[Mozilla's security team](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/)
or open a Bugzilla report on your behalf. We'll always coordinate
disclosure timing with you before doing so.

## Recognition

Researchers who report verified vulnerabilities are credited in the
release notes for the patch release that fixes the issue, unless
they request to remain anonymous.
